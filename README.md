# Muti-Level-Encryption-

this work aims to introduce a technique using multiple encryption processes to improve security in communication and showing its implementation. The method is based on one main principle: encrypting data multiple times using different algorithms. Using different methods to encrypt data multiple times provides huge protection. 
These features are described and analysed to see their advantages and drawbacks and how they are applied to the method defined. In addition, a great overview of encryption and cryptography is made in order to see the evolution and importance of these fields over the years and the current techniques and methods which are used nowadays to protect our information.



Encryption techniques Used : TRIPLE DES, AES, BLOWFISH, RSA ALGORITHM
